      title: Thank you for giving me my hearing back
      text: "I thought my hearing was ok and I didn't need any hearing aids. But I noticed that I was saying \"Huh\" quite often to people that was talking to me. I also was always asking for the volume to be turned up on the TV."

    - name: Ron K.
      title: Absolutely love them
      text: "I purchased a pair of Oricle Hearing aid 2.0 and love them. I had purchased a pair of Starkey hearing aids which I had paid $3,800.00 for and the hearing on the Oricle 2.0 is 5 times better and I only have it set on half power. Absolutely love them."

    - name: Donald F.
      title: I am completely satisfied
      text: "I have had several hearing devices over the past few years. They all have been relatively satisfactory, most after testing for my hearing deficiency and adjusting for the frequencies most in need of amplification and ambient conditions."
